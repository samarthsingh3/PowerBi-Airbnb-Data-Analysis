# Analysis of Airbnb Data Using Power BI

## Project Overview

Airbnb, headquartered in San Francisco, California, operates a popular online marketplace specializing in short-term accommodations and experiences. Established in 2008 by founders Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia, the name Airbnb is derived from its original moniker, AirBedandBreakfast.com. iVision analytics firm has been provided with datasets related to Airbnb listings and reviewer scores worldwide. The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of Airbnb's operations and draw meaningful insights from the data. As a BI Analyst at iVision, I have created informative reports by conducting a thorough analysis of the data using powerful tools like Power BI.

## Software/Tools
- Power BI

## Data Description
- **Reviews (Reviews.csv)**: Contains information about reviews left for Airbnb listings.
- **Listings (Listings.csv)**: Contains all relevant details about the listed stays.
- **Listings_data_dictionary.csv**: Data dictionary for Listings.csv.
- **Reviews_data_dictionary.csv**: Data dictionary for Reviews.csv.

## Business Objective
The primary objective is to analyze Airbnb data to reveal insights into user experiences and satisfaction levels with the numerous listed stays, all accomplished using Power BI.

## Project Goals
1. **Assessing District Location Scores**: Pinpoint the location in the district with the least favorable location scores.
2. **Examining Host Response Time Impact**: Delve into the relationship between host response times and the overall ratings of Airbnb listings, providing valuable insights.
3. **Visualizing Airbnb Listing Prices**: Create visual representations of Airbnb listing prices across different cities and summarize any noteworthy trends or variations.
4. **Analyzing Composite Scores**: Create a composite score that integrates check-in experience and host communication for various districts with subsequent analysis and insights.
5. **Calculating Listing Age and Host Tenure**: Compute the age of Airbnb listings and identify hosts who have accumulated more than ten years of hosting expertise.
6. **Property Type Price Analysis**: Create a visual tree map that displays average prices for various room and property types with specific attention given to the property type associated with the highest prices for entire places.
7. **Crafting a Comprehensive City Insights Report**: Create a comprehensive report that presents listing prices, guest ratings, and visitor trends for multiple cities, with a particular focus on assessing changes in visitor trends in 2020 in contrast to earlier years.
